        <h1>About Sandy</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I am William (nickname Sandy). I was a teacher of the deaf, now
          recently retired and residing in Victoria, BC. My hobbies include
          gardening, biking, woodworking and pyrography (meaning woodburning).
          During woodworking, I have been doing restoration on old dressers and
          woodburning on them images such as trees to show our care for nature
          and our environment. I collect fallen branches from windstorms, cut
          them into rounds, and then do woodburning of images. Images may be
          trees or ASL signs such as 'ILY' (I love you) to express support for
          deaf culture as well as positive feelings for others. Plaques,
          coasters and pins are some others things I do for charity and open
          commissions, especially for those in need.
